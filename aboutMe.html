                Hello, my name is Jojo. I live in germany and I enjoy coding, politics and art. At
                the moment, my main focus lies on politics.

                Im active in leftist political parties and I enjoy polictical work.

            <p>
                I also love coding. I started coding in C# when I was 10 years old. Later i began
                learning HTML, CSS and Java and now, Im studying computer science. A lot of times, 
                I coded computer games in C#, but I never finished a game and always started new ones.
                Follwing that I started learning HTML and CSS. I love the simplicity and what you can
                do with it. I also want to start learning JavaScript, but I haven't found the time yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main art projects are grafitty. While I'm not the best in drawing, I enjoy
                graffitying with friends and drawing drafts.
