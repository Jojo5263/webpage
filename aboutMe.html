                Hello, my name is Jojo. I live in germany and I enjoy coding, politics, art and music. 
                At the moment, my main focus lies on politics.

                I also love coding. I started coding in C# when I was 10 years old. Later i began
                learning HTML, CSS and Java and now, Im studying computer science. A lot of times, 
                I coded computer games in C#, but I never finished a game and always started new ones.
                Follwing that I started learning HTML and CSS. I love the simplicity and what you can
                do with it. I also want to start learning JavaScript, but I haven't found the time yet.
            </p>

                My main art projects are grafitty. While I'm not the best in drawing, I enjoy
                graffitying with friends and drawing drafts.

                My favourit musical instrument the my electrical guitar. I mainly play rythm guitar,
                but sometimes I learn melodies. I mostly play rock and metal, but sometimes I enjoy
                playing pop with my acoustical guitar. Also, I play the drums. I've played it since
                I was 6 y.o, but I haven't play it very much recently. I also have a piano, but 
                stopped playing a while ago and forgot I everything.
