                Hello, my name is Jojo. I live in germany and I enjoy coding, politics, art and music. 
                At the moment, my main focus lies on politics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Im active in left-wing political parties and I enjoy political work. 
            </p>

                I also love coding. I started coding in C# when I was 10 years old. Later I began
                learning HTML, CSS and Java and now, Im studying computer science. A lot of times, 
                I coded computer games in C#, but I never finished a game and always started new ones.
                Following that I started learning HTML and CSS. I love the simplicity and what you can
                do with it. I also want to start learning JavaScript, but I haven't found the time yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main art projects are graffity. While I'm not the best in drawing, I enjoy
                graffitying with friends and drawing drafts. 
            </p>

                My favourite musical instrument is my electrical guitar. I mainly play rythm guitar,
                but sometimes I learn melodies. I mostly play rock and metal, but sometimes I enjoy
                playing pop with my acoustical guitar. Also, I play the drums. I've played it since
                I was 6 y.o, but I haven't played it very much recently. I also have a piano, but 
                stopped playing a while ago and forgot everything.
